# ADR-001: Architectural Design Choices for Cash Flow Control System

## Context

We are building an Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) solution to deliver a reliable, resilient, and powerful cash flow application. The system is implemented using .NET 8 with microservices to improve separation of concerns, autoscaling, and performance.

The supporting projection technologies are MongoDB for read models and EventStoreDB for event storage, which acts as the single source of truth. RabbitMQ is used for reliable asynchronous event delivery between services, secured using mutual TLS (mTLS).

The system uses Kong as an API Gateway to act as a reverse proxy and enforce authentication. Distributed transactions across microservices are managed using a choreography-based Saga pattern.

Each microservice runs inside its own Docker container, and containers are orchestrated by Kubernetes for scalability and high availability.

For observability, the system leverages an open-source stack:
- **Sidecar:** OpenTelemetry Collector for metrics, traces, and logs instrumentation.  
- **Metrics Backend:** Prometheus and Grafana for scraping, storing, and visualizing metrics.  
- **Distributed Tracing:** Jaeger for tracing request flows across services.  
- **Logging:** Elasticsearch serves as the storage and search engine for logs and telemetry data, with Kibana as the visualization and dashboard tool.

We deliberately avoided introducing paid libraries and tools unless strictly necessary, aiming to keep costs low and avoid future vendor lock-in. At the same time, we leveraged proven open-source libraries when using them would prevent reinventing the wheel.

The application is designed to be deployable in cloud computing solutions (PaaS or IaaS) or on-premises using virtual machines.

## Decision

We will proceed with the following architectural and technology design for CashFlow:

- Distributed system with microservice architecture.  
- MongoDB for projections (read models).  
- EventStoreDB for event sourcing and as the single source of truth.  
- RabbitMQ for reliable asynchronous messaging between services, secured with mTLS.  
- Kong API Gateway as reverse proxy and authentication enforcer.  
- Choreography-based Saga pattern for distributed transaction management.  
- Containerization of microservices with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes.  
- Observability stack consisting of OpenTelemetry Collector, Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger, Elasticsearch, and Kibana.  
- Avoid paid dependencies unless strictly necessary.

## Consequences

### Benefits

- **Low cost:** No licensing fees for core database engines; minimal reliance on paid dependencies.  
- **Simple deployment:** Compatible with IaaS or on-prem environments, supporting flexible hosting options.  
- **Separation of concerns:** Clear ownership and isolation of microservices improve maintainability.  
- **Fault tolerance and resilience:** Event-driven and microservices design increases system robustness.  
- **Quick and efficient autoscaling:** Microservices can scale independently based on demand.  
- **Robust observability:** Comprehensive monitoring, tracing, and logging enables rapid diagnosis and system health insights.  
- **Secure and scalable communication:** mTLS-secured RabbitMQ and API Gateway ensure secure, scalable interactions.

### Trade-offs

- **Longer development time:** Microservice architectures require more initial setup and complexity than monolithic applications, including infrastructure, inter-service communication, and deployment pipelines.  
- **Operational complexity:** Distributed systems require careful monitoring, logging, and handling of eventual consistency.  
- **Learning curve:** Developers and operators need familiarity with event sourcing, CQRS, distributed messaging, secure messaging protocols, container orchestration, and observability tooling.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Monolithic architecture with ASP.NET Core MVC:** Simpler to implement initially but harder to scale and evolve.  
- **Feature-level modularization using vertical slice architecture:** Improves modularity but less separation than microservices.  
- **Using MySQL for structured data persistence:** Provides relational schema but less suited for event sourcing and flexible projections.  
- **Simple VM or on-premises hosting:** Chosen but with potential cloud deployment for scalability.

## Next Steps

- Implement application health checks to monitor service status.
- Develop and integrate a MongoDB connection pool handler.
- Implement Fraud Control Service to detect potential inconsistencies and security breaches.
- Integrate authentication for intranet, potentially leveraging a service mesh for enhanced security and traffic control.
